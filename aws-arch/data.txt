answer: B
note: It's important in this question to note that the instance is in a VPC to rule out other answers. Any instance storage device is only persisted during the running life of the instance because instance storage is physically attached to the host rather than NAS storage like EBS. Now part of the reason that instance storage only persists while an instance is powered on is because the host could/always changes when the instance is started. Remember that instance resources are very loosely coupled with other resources. When you start an instance it gets a resource reservation on a carefully chosen, presumably with some complex algorithm, available host.

122. In the basic monitoring package for EC2, Amazon CloudWatch provides the following metrics:
A web server visible metrics such as number failed transaction requests
B operating system visible metrics such as memory utilization
C database visible metrics such as number of connections
D hypervisor visible metrics such as CPU utilization
answer: D
note: A responsibility boundary exists between the hypervisor and guest operating system. AWS does not have access to the guest operating system and therefore cannot see anything that isn't visible to the hypervisor. Such information would be resource demands of the guest operating system that the hypervisor must service like, CPU usage. Refer back to the shared responsibility model discussed in the AWS Security Whitepaper. http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/pdf/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf

123. Which is an operational process performed by AWS for data security?
A AES-256 encryption of data stored on any shared storage device
B Decommissioning of storage devices using industry-standard practices
C Replication of data across multiple AWS Regions
D Secure wiping of EBS data when an EBS volume is unmounted
answer: B
note:  The key to this question is understanding again the shared responsibility boundary between AWS and its customers as well as the specific statement "operational process". Again we need to refer to the AWS Security Whitepaper. As a standard practice AWS shreds all physical disks after magnetically wiping them as part of their decommissioning process. 

124. To protect S3 data from both accidental deletion and accidental overwriting, you should:
A enable S3 versioning on the bucket
B access S3 data using only signed URLs
C disable S3 delete using an IAM bucket policy
D enable S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
answer: A
note: By enabling versioning you ensure that if accidentally or otherwise overwritten any previous object version is persisted as a previous version. In addition you protect against complete loss from accidental deletion

125. Does S3 provide read-after-write consistency?
A No, not for any region
B Yes, but only for certain regions
C Yes, but only for certain regions and for new objects
D Yes, for all regions
answer: C
note: S3’s consistency model is that of eventual consistency. This means that when an object is stored in S3, it is replicated in different datacenters (availability zones) in the same region. And it can take a short amount of time before all the data centers have a uniform view of the object (This time is usually less than a second, but if system is in distress it could take much longer). Thus in essence, S3 does not provide read-after-write consistency. But the S3 team has modified the algorithm so as to provide read-after-write consistency for new objects. Which means that if I upload “object-n” for the first time (lets call it version-1), I get the opportunity to immediately read it without any consistency issues. This is though not supported for US-East region. Thus S3 support read-after-write consistency for new objects but for all regions except US-East.

126. What is the maximum size of a single S3 object?
A There is no such limit
B 5 TB
C 5 GB
D 100 GB
answer: B
note: Using multipart upload, a single object in S3 can be upto 5TB in size.

127. Is data stored in S3 is always encrypted?
A Yes, S3 always encrypts data for security
B No, there is no such feature
C Yes, but only when right APIs are called
D Yes, but only in Gov Cloud datacenters
answer: C
note: S3 by default do not encrypt the data stored into its service. But using Server Side Encryption feature, if proper headers are passes (in REST), S3 will first encrypt the data and then store that encrypted data.

128. What is true for S3 buckets (select multiple if more than one is true)?
A Bucket namespace is shared and is global among all AWS users.
B Bucket names can contain alpha numeric characters
C Bucket are associated with a region, and all data in a bucket resides in that region
D Buckets can be transferred from one account to another through API
answer: A,B,C
note: Bucket namespace is global, which means that if someone creates a bucket called “pics” nobody else can create a bucket of the same name. Bucket names can contain alphanumeric characters which means we can have a bucket named “cloudthat1234”. And when we create a bucket, we have to select a region for the bucket, and all data stored in that bucket is physically stored in that region only (although the data can be accessed from anywhere in the world with proper credentials).

129. EBS can always tolerate an Availability Zone failure?
A No, all EBS volume is stored in a single Availability Zone
B Yes, EBS volume has multiple copies so it should be fine
C Depends on how it is setup
D Depends on the Region where EBS volume is initiated
answer: A
note: One of the known fallacies of EBS is that all the data of a single volume lives in a single Availability Zone. Thus it cannot withstand Availability zone failures.

130. Which of the following Auto scaling CANNOT do (select multiple if more than one is true)?
A Start up EC2 instances when CPU utilization is above threshold
B Release EC2 instances when CPU utilization is below threshold
C Increase the instance size when utilization is above threshold
D Add more Relational Database Service (RDS) read replicas when utilization is above threshold
answer: C,D
note: Auto scaling cannot increase instance size of an EC2 instance. The idea is to be able to scale horizontally, and not vertically. Also D is correct as Auto scaling currently cannot automate RDS instance to do anything.

131. Which of the following benefits does adding Multi-AZ deployment in RDS provide (choose multiple if more than one is true)?
A MultiAZ deployed database can tolerate an Availability Zone failure
B Decrease latencies if app servers accessing database are in multiple Availability zones
C Make database access times faster for all app servers
D Make database more available during maintenance tasks
answer: A,D
note: RDS MultiAZ does make database a single AZ failure tolerant, as it has automatic failover feature, where the secondly will become primary and application can keep accessing the database. It also increases availability during maintenance, as maintenance is performed first on secondary, then its made primary and then old-primary is updated.

132. What happens to data when an EC2 instance terminates (select multiple if more than one is true)?
A For EBS backed AMI, the EBS volume with operation system on it is preserved
B For EBS backed AMI, any volume attached other than the OS volume is preserved
C All the snapshots of the EBS volume with operating system is preserved
D For S3 backed AMI, all the data in the local (ephemeral) hard drive is deleted
answer: B,C,D

133. For an EC2 instance launched in a private subnet in VPC, which of the following are the options for it to be able to connect to the internet (assume security groups have proper ports open).
A Simply attach an elastic IP
B If there is also a public subnet in the same VPC, an ENI can be attached to the instance with the ip address range of the public subnet
C If there is a public subnet in the same VPC with a NAT instance attached to internet gateway, then a route can be configured from the instance to the NAT
D There is no way for an instance in private subnet to talk to the internet
answer: C

134. When an ELB is setup, what is the best way to route a website’s traffic to it?
A Resolve the ELB name to an ip address  and point the website to that ip address
B There is no direct way to do so, Route53 has to be used
C Generate a CNAME record for the website pointing to the DNS name of the ELB
answer: C
note: The ip address of an ELB can change, so it’s not advisable to point domain directly at that ip address. Instead use CNAME to map to the ELB DNS name

135. An instance is launched into the public subnet of a VPC. Which of the following must be done in order for it to be accessible FROM the Internet?
A Attach an Elastic IP to the instance
B Nothing. The instance is accessible from the Internet
C Launch a NAT instance and route all traffic to it
D Make an entry in the route table passing all traffic going outside the VPC to the NAT instance
answer: A

136. In VPCs with private and public subnets, database servers should ideally be launched into:
A The public subnet
B The private subnet
C Either of them
D Not recommended, they should ideally be launched outside VPC
answer: B

137. An instance is connected to an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in one subnet. What happens when you attach an ENI of a different subnet to this instance?
A The instance follows the rules of the older subnet
B The instance follows the rules of both the subnets
C The instance follows the rules of the newer subnet
D Not possible cannot be connected to 2 ENIs

148. A customer has a 10 GB AWS Direct Connect connection to an AWS region where they have a web application hosted on Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2). The application has dependencies on an on-premises mainframe database that uses a BASE (Basic Available. Sort stale Eventual consistency) rather than an ACID (Atomicity. Consistency isolation. Durability) consistency model. The application is exhibiting undesirable behavior because the database is not able to handle the volume of writes. How can you reduce the load on your on-premises database resources in the most cost-effective way? 
A Use an Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) S3DistCp as a synchronization mechanism between the on-premises database and a Hadoop cluster on AWS. 
B Modify the application to write to an Amazon SQS queue and develop a worker process to flush the queue to the on-premises database. 
C Modify the application to use DynamoDB to feed an EMR cluster which uses a map function to write to the on-premises database. 
D Provision an RDS read-replica database on AWS to handle the writes and synchronize the two databases using Data Pipeline.
answer: A

151. You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached The EC2 Instance Is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS The two EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID o device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4.000 IOPS (4 000 16KB reads or writes) for a total of 16.000 random IOPS on the instance The EC2 Instance initially delivers the expected 16 000 IOPS random read and write performance Sometime later in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID Each volume Is provisioned to 4.000 lOPs like the original four for a total of 24.000 IOPS on the EC2 instance Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%. but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution? 
A Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates: increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB. 
B The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized use an EBS-Optimized instance that provides larger throughput. 
C Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I'O throughput, configure the instance device driver and file system to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
D RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices, use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes but increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6.000 IOPS. 
E The standard EBS instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate, change the instant root volume to also be a 500GB 4.000 Provisioned IOPS volume.

154. You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few calls/second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible? 
A Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for -Active calls" and one for -Terminated calls". In this way the "Active calls_ table is always small and effective to access.
B Use DynamoDB with a "Calls" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "IsActive'" attribute that is present for active calls only In this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective. 
C Use DynamoDB with a 'Calls" table and a Global secondary index on a 'State" attribute that can equal to "active" or "terminated" in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table. 
D Use RDS Multi-AZ with a "CALLS" table and an Indexed "STATE* field that can be equal to 'ACTIVE" or -TERMINATED" In this way the SOL query Is optimized by the use of the Index.

159. Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence. The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%. Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the anticipated additional load'* Why?
A. Yes. you should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the ROS Instance will not Be able to handle the load It me cache node fails. 
B. No. if the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability impact. 
C. Yes you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB master instance to handle the load if one cache node fails. 
D. No if the cache node fails you can always get the same data from the DB without having any availability impact.
Answer: B

160.

161. An International company has deployed a multi-tier web application that relies on DynamoDB in a single region For regulatory reasons they need disaster recovery capability In a separate region with a Recovery Time Objective of 2 hours and a Recovery Point Objective of 24 hours They should synchronize their data on a regular basis and be able to provision me web application rapidly using CloudFormation. The objective is to minimize changes to the existing web application, control the throughput of DynamoDB used for the synchronization of data and synchronize only the modified elements. Which design would you choose to meet these requirements? 
A. Use AWS data Pipeline to schedule a DynamoDB cross region copy once a day. create a Lastupdated' attribute in your DynamoDB table that would represent the timestamp of the last update and use it as a filter.

162. Your company currently has a 2-tier web application running in an on-premises data center. You have experienced several infrastructure failures in the past two months resulting in significant financial losses. Your CIO is strongly agreeing to move the application to AWS. While working on achieving buy-in from the other company executives, he asks you to develop a disaster recovery plan to help improve Business continuity in the short term. He specifies a target Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour or less. He also asks you to implement the solution within 2 weeks. Your database is 200GB in size and you have a 20Mbps Internet connection. How would you do this while minimizing costs? 
A. Create an EBS backed private AMI which includes a fresh install or your application. Setup a script in your data center to backup the local database every 1 hour and to encrypt and copy the resulting file to an S3 bucket using multi-part upload. 
B. Install your application on a compute-optimized EC2 instance capable of supporting the application's average load synchronously replicate transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance in AWS across a secure Direct Connect connection. 
C. Deploy your application on EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group across multiple availability zones asynchronously replicate transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance in AWS across a secure VPN connection.
D. Create an EBS backed private AMI that includes a fresh install of your application. Develop a Cloud Formation template which includes your Mil and the required EC2. Auto-Scaling and ELB resources to support deploying the application across Multiple-Ability Zones. Asynchronously replicate transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance in AWS across a secure VPN connection.

163. An ERP application is deployed across multiple AZs in a single region. In the event of failure, the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) must be less than 3 hours, and the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) must be 15 minutes the customer realizes that data corruption occurred roughly 1.5 hours ago. What DR strategy could be used to achieve this RTO and RPO in the event of this kind of failure? 
A. Take hourly DB backups to S3, with transaction logs stored in S3 every 5 minutes. 
B. Use synchronous database master-slave replication between two availability zones. 
C. Take hourly DB backups to EC2 Instance store volumes with transaction logs stored In S3 every 5 minutes. 
D. Take 15 minute DB backups stored In Glacier with transaction logs stored in S3 every 5 minutes.
